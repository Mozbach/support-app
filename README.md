Ok, so this was / is my first MER application.
After all is said and done, it still feels very incomplete.
I need to still add a backend for staff to communicate with the users, so that in itself is a whole other canarrie!
Being my first MERN app, this was really, really difficult.
Not only working with Redux but trying to figure out the differences between Redux and the Redux Toolkit.
Never before this have I worked with MongoDB, which in itself was not too bad, but the setup was completely different from the crayon-level Firestore I am used to.

Overall, great experience and I definately learnt a lot.

I will write more in this as time progresses and this thing grows.
